06.12.2020: Mr. Berrian emailed me back saying that he was interested in July Marineland. He asked if it was vet only, couple's only, or vet and caregiver. I informed him that it was meant for a support person of his choosing as long as they were over the age of 18. I also asked him for a good time for us to call to start the vetting process. -JL

06.18.2020: Mr. Berrian gave me a call back and said that July Marineland dates and times worked for him and his support person. His wife Mrs. Christen is still his support person that he will bring on the retreat. He served in the army as a 74D and did a combat tour in 2003. He said that transportation was not a problem and that he was confident in getting childcare for his 5 children, but he would double check and give Deana a go or no go on childcare. He has been on a lot of retreats and went to one in Tampa for GA in 2017 and said he really enjoyed it and his wife also really enjoyed the support person side of things. He is hoping to strengthen his bond with his wife. He is scheduled to vet with Deana on Friday the 18th at 11:00 am. -JL

06.18.2020: Spoke to Kyle and discussed schedule, expectations, and childcare arrangements and driving distance. Kyle confirmed childcare is solid, and he and Christen are committed. Kyle discussed his 9-year time in the Army as the best experience. He is currently rated at 80% disability. He discussed that his TBI diagnosis was confirmed by private doctors, and not the VA. He is currently separated from his wife, and living with his parents, while his wife is with the children in the family home.  He explained that his wife has been his rock and he hasn't been applying the necessary skills to help his relationship, and now they are separated but speak daily. Christen is wanting to learn more about her role as a support person as she is exhausted. They would like to learn skills to sustain them in their future. They have attended a previous GA retreat in Tampa at an old monastery near a river.  Kyle stated that they learned so much and this helped his wife to find hope in their marriage. -DE

06.08.2020: Mr. Olsen called me back and said that he was interested and available for July Marineland. He said that his support person was still Mrs. Amelia and that she was his rock. He asked to have her present during the vetting calls because he struggles with memory loss due to injuries from his time in service and she helps him fill in the blanks. He said that transportation was not a problem even though Phenix City is 350 miles away. He was in the US Army and served in 4 post 9/11 combat deployments. He said he had a few MOS numbers but the two he gave me were 88M and 11B. He said that he had children but they were all over the age of 18 and ""grown and flown"". He said that he was looking for a few things from the retreat. The main thing was that he has a lot of things that he feels like he has bottled up and needs to share and finally let air out. He also said that he wanted to grow stronger with his wife because they have a great relationship and she is very supportive of him and his PTS. He is scheduled to meet with Deana later today (06.08.2020) at 4:00 pm for secondary vetting. -JL

06.08.2020: Michael called me back and we discussed dates, schedule, expectations and he and his wife Amelia confirmed and are ready to attend. Michael confirmed mileage of 350 miles from his home to retreat as acceptable to drive. Michael served in the Army 22 years in a variety of roles; 88M-Motor Transport Operator, 11 Bravo-Infantryman, Blackhawk Door Gunner, 717 Calvary Unit (earned his Stetson and gold spurs). Michael received his TBI diagnosis in 2010 but injuries were received in 2003. Michael was medically retired in 2013. He is 100% disabled and receives all care from VA. Discussed with Michael about any physical limitations he acknowledge some ligament and joint issues but reassured that he can attend and participate in all retreat activities including kayaking.  Amelia is Michael's caregiver. Michael is currently working on a podcast, writing a feature film script (out for preproduction next year about a 2004 Iraq incident), and he enjoys writing. Michael and Amelia enjoy flea markets (watching flea market flip), and movies but are really comfortable being home bodies. Michael and Amelia lived in Panama City Beach, FL but moved to Phenix City, Alabama because of lower cost of living two months before hurricane Michael. Michael would like to get closer to his wife emotionally and learn how to communicate to Amelia about his past.  He stated, he wants to learn to turn the negatives of his past into a positive future. Amelia stated that she desires a closeness in her marriage and a communication at a deeper level. Michael and Amelia have two grown daughters-he did not give specifics but daughters are independently living. -DE"

He said he's taking medication and doing better now.  I wasn't sure whether to approve him at the time of the call, so I told that the application was still being reviewed and would get back in touch with him within a week.  I talked to Ashley later in the day, and we agreed to approve them for the retreat.  I spoke to Sandra today and they accepted the offer to attend.  - MW

Lived in FL all of life. stays home most of time. no children. wants rest and relaxation and clarity on future for him and wife. scheduled with Sarah 02/28 @ 4pm. -TP
2.28.20-Confirmed military experience.  Since discharge, spends days spending time with wife, they go to the gym together and just hanging around together.  Neither work or go to school or volunteer, and have no kids.  They have family in town they are able to see and he has some friends/vets he sees and is able to connect with but “never enough”. No sense of isolation in spite of their limited activities and engagement, and goals for retreat are to connect with wife and find clarity for their future, so it seems they are ready to grow and find new avenues.  He did not feel physical limitations would impede participation.  History of alcohol/addiction/dependency, says it is a daily work in progress but has not had issue with this for over six months. Has some professional support for these issues (VA/therapy) but it has been limited for the last year, as he has been doing better with all of it, so hasn’t been in as intense of treatment.  Seemed very interested in PTG and because of their goals for the retreat this seems it will be a very good fit for them, as they are positive and active but also not currently engaged in much.  No kids/work/school to workaround, dates confirmed repeatedly.  Approved app. -SD

2.28.20-Confirmed military experience.  Currently an RN and works as a care manager for the VA.  No hobbies, etc. to speak of because she is a single mom with an 8 and 10 year old, twin grandchildren on the way, and a 70 year old mom she helps care for who just had surgery and is in need of a second surgery.  She feels she has no time for herself at all.  Does not seem isolated or withdrawn at all, but definitely very busy/maxed out/burned out.  When asked goals for retreat she really couldn’t answer clearly, said this was not her typical thing to go do, or to take time for herself, but is definitely looking forward to time away, a change to recharge, and to learn the skills.  HIGHLY recommend for PATHH if she can get the time away from work/kids, she said she would think about applying over the next year or so as kids get older/more independent.  Incredibly sweet and positive, just also completely maxed.  Dates confirmed.  Approved app. -SD

He was medically discharged and didn't want to leave military but was not physically able to stay, now disabled. Got aa but hasn't been able to keep a job since discharging from the military. During time in military his partner left because of his behavior and he began to drink heavily.  Got clean and returned to active duty before discharge in 2011.

Moved to his area a year ago and doesn't have a support network, has isolation, no hobbies or work, no family or vets around, but does volunteer with Team Savannah for Veterans, so he's helping out and meeting other vets.  Otherwise he says he spends more time on his back than a prostitute. No support person, but he said he will try to find someone.

1.30.20-Spoke with applicant, confirmed military experience.  Work as medic meant lots of work with children. Feels a lot of weight from that work as well as one situation in particular where she was forced to discontinue care for an abused child under her care when the parents demanded the return of the child.  Says she never felt scared or trauma experience when deployed, only felt it when she returned.  Has worked in the medical field since return but wouldn't work with children and thought she'd be okay but even working with adults is hurtful to her so now she works in a job she feels is unimportant but can't hurt her.  Husband is veteran also but they've already discussed and she will be attending as soldier and him as support person.  Hobbies include buying using dolls and painting them as zombies, working on the Foxhole support network she started and turned into a nonprofit, and she spends time with her husband. No family near her and few civilian friends but she does like spending time with her military friends. Wants to attend retreat for new skills and to network both by sharing our info with her nonprofit and learning about new resources and meeting new people.

Terminal leave in 2010, full time student on and off until 2016 and then did virginia college from 2014-2016 and did security for jags and gators from 2012-2018, volunteered at city rescue mission after 2011 and has done lots of certification programs like home builders and IT. Uses local VA.  Doesn’t have any family in town and ex-wife/daughter in Palm Coast, doesn’t really have support network locally.  Sometimes goes to Vet Center for appts.  Has friends but not able to see them very often.  Health answers pulled from old app not accurate, he said he has no history of drug/alcohol use or addiction or suicidal thoughts. Felt surprised by VA diagnosis of PTSD because he felt like it didn’t really affect him. He feels like he wants to do good by others and feels clear headed and rational.  Wishes he could see his daughter more but otherwise wants to spend his time doing stuff and being good.

2.27.20-Confirmed military experience.  Not working or in school right now.  Did vocational training while in the military, but was withdrawn from it because of mental and physical health after last deployment.  Has about six appts a week (cardiology, podiatry, injections in knees/back/hips, physical therapy, rheumatology, group counseling, individual counseling, couples counseling) that keep him busy.  See individual therapist 2x/month, group therapy 1x/week, and couples counselor 1x/month.  Feels he shuts himself off but he does not like or feel comfortable with people around him who don’t understand his experiences.  Volunteered for awhile but was let go because he had a panic attack in a crowded event he was volunteering at.  While deployed he was in a situation where a bomb went off nearby, killing two of his friends he was deployed with as well as children that were playing in the area.  When he’s in crowds he has flashbacks to this situation.  His group members are trying to get him to go to the VFW, and his therapist is encouraging him to be more vulnerable and open, so he started going to church recently, which was a huge step for him.  He feels he wants to expose himself more and be more vulnerable because he feels always on guard, and he recognizes he’s not in combat anymore so he wants to be able to relax and find a comfort spot that isn’t his bedroom or group.  Being around other veterans who understand him and his experiences is very important to him.  Confirmed dates several times. Approved app (and recommended PATHH after Chatuge). -SD

12.4.19-Spoke w/applicant. Confirmed military experience, medically retired one year ago, did not want to leave military but physically had to. Has had some difficulty adjusting to life outside of military, felt she had a slump at the beginning and is now in a second slump.  Took a year off intentionally to travel to see family and process but now needs to look at school or other options for what to do and is missing the military and wishing she was still in, feels she is questioning everything.  Spends time with family, works on fixing up house and doing yardwork, goes to appointments at vet center.  Her and wife have two friends local, WWP stuff has been super helpful because she really, really likes connecting with other vets.  She is trying to find her confidence again and doing stuff she likes like working on her jeep.  She’s typically a very social person so the last year has been challenging because it’s been more withdrawn.  She is excited about the PTG concepts, about the recreational activities, and about connecting with other vets. Approved for attendance. -SD

Goals for retreat are primarily that he wants to reconnect with wife and secondly spend time with other vets. Went to a family retreat with kids and wife in CO about six months ago and said it was amazing. Approved to come. -SD"

Moved from Fort Bragg to Hinesville near Fort Stewart, has had open heart surgery since and is plugged in with the VA for support and medical help.  Has completed recovery from surgery and rehab and feels comfortable participating in retreat activities.  Because of health issues including stroke, heart problems, and gout he has not been able to get out and do as much as he would like, and is newer to the area than he was to Bragg, so doesn't know many people in his area, but doesn't seem isolated overall.  Said he sees his kids and grandkids often and him and his wife either have family in from South Carolina or they go see family in SC often.  He is hoping to attend the retreat to learn better skills to reconnect with his wife and also to meet other veterans because he feels he doesn't get to meet as many other military members since retiring and wants to connect with others and find resources and relationships.

4.29.20:  NEED TO CALL TO INIVTE TO JUNE CHATUGE

06.08.2020- Out of range for ML July, moving to LO Sept. -JL

7.13.20:  Deana, when/if you vet, please find out more about the health condition that prevented him from attending the last retreat.  Need to gauge possibility of that happening again and if he is also considered a ""high risk"" group for covid (just for our own frame of reference, we don't have policies or such about it).
7.13.2020: I gave Mr. Verdun a call. He said that he was interested and available in the LO September retreat and the dates and times worked for him. His support person is Mrs. Aretha. He served in the US Army as an 11B. He served 3 tours in Iraq post 9/11. He has no children. He said that he has been to a few smaller WWP events. He hopes to gain a closer bond with Mrs. Aretha on this retreat. He is scheduled to vet with Deana tomorrow (7/14/2020) at 11:00 am. -JL
7.14.2020: Spoke with Edward regarding the scheduled activities, expectations and COVID-19 concerns. Edward expressed that his wife, Aretha is Pre-Diabetic and was initially concerned about the exposure due to COVID-19, but has since been practicing social distancing, wearing her mask, and is getting more comfortable getting out.  Edward is currently nursing a rotator cuff injury and shoulder injury but has agreed to participate in all activities including recreational. Edward served 15 years in the Army; and then 6 years in Army NG. He is currently at 90% Disability and employable. Edward and his wife are hoping to have an opportunity to strengthen their relationship, as the current COVID-19 has stretched their patience and challenged their relationship. Edward and his wife attend a local church and were active in activities prior to COVID-19.  Edward expressed his desire to attend the retreat and learn better coping and communication skills with his wife. -DE

10.23.19-No work/school/kids so able to get away. Spinal injury from bad landing on jump in 2012.  Had to terminate jump status, and says at Ft Bragg if you’re not on jump status/pcs/able to deploy the army is done with you. Tried to get clearance b/c he felt still able to do his job but was medically retired in 2015.  A few months prior he’d lost his father, who he was very close with and who was a big support of his, so he felt two big losses within a close time span. He had a very rough transition and ended up having a nervous breakdown and being put on a 24 hour emergency hold-not suicidal, just didn’t feel like he knew how to live life as a civilian.  Took a while to find purpose after this, but has gotten help and does a lot with his Wounded Warrior-knew what PTG was and seems on that path already.  Spends time with other vets through WW and has gone on one retreat with them-Project Odyssey-but it’s been awhile.  No serious hobbies, like to play video games, go to shooting range, spend time with wife.  He knows how important it is he get out of the house and do stuff so he still does that, just nothing specific, outside of stuff with WW.  Approved for attendance.-SD"

crochet, paint, calligraphy, piano.
transition since retirement - don't want to work, lots of anxiety - does not go shopping - hard to be around people, likes to be alone.  has low tolerance to many things, esp stupidity of others.
husband served as well, he is also dealing with some things . both are in survival mode
has 3 grown kids.
husband retired military in 2004 and was working PT until last year, and his wife and daughter convinced him to not work anymore.

PTS - bad dreams constantly, the phone
wants to join work force.  wants to work on trusting others.
has been to therapy before, but didn't work very well - attributes this to not clicking with the practitioner, and then having to start over with a new one makes it difficult.
taking psy meds, but has not noticed a small change in how feels with them.  still feels very anxious.
goals: interact with others with more ease, be more trusting, listen to others, learn from others
